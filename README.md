# Ganimedes 
A new late game moon very worthy to make possible higher quotas!
My priority making this moon has been the gameplay, the variety of routes and the exploration to make moving around the map interesting and fun.

>POPULATION: Abandoned.

>CONDITIONS: Jagged and dry, it is a old mine.

>HISTORY: Ganimedes is known for having been the largest mine moon, however now it is abandoned. It still has riches inside but the risk is too high.

>FAUNA: A great variety of aggresive and dangerous lifeforms inhabits this moon.

It needs some balancing so I will be testing it and updating, don't hesitate to report bugs or suggestions in my github. 
I will be investigating LethalLevelLoader as well and if it works better I will migrate the mod to the new API.

# New scrap 
6 new thematic scraps that only appear on the new moon! Maybe there is some surprise ;)
