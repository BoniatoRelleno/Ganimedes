# Ganimedes 
A new late game moon very worthy to make possible higher quotas!
My priority making this moon has been the gameplay, the variety of routes and the exploration to make moving around the map interesting and fun.

>POPULATION: Abandoned.

>CONDITIONS: Jagged and dry, it is a old mine.

>HISTORY: Ganimedes is known for having been the largest mine moon, however now it is abandoned. It still has riches inside but the risk is too high.

>FAUNA: A great variety of aggressive and dangerous lifeforms inhabits this moon.

>COST: 1200 (you can change it from the configuration file)

The internal name for custom dungeon interiors is just `Ganimedes`

I will continue improving and updating it, so don't hesitate to report bugs or suggestions in my [github](https://github.com/BoniatoRelleno/Ganimedes) or in the Ganimedes thread located in the "mod-releases" channel of the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/6ds27tH8). All feedback is appreciated <3

# New scrap 
8 new thematic scraps that only appear on the new moon! Maybe there is some surprise ;)
